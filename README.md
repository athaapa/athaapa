# Hi, I'm Ayush

I build software, work on games, and explore projects in math, programming, and AI. 

## Projects
- **[ContextFlow](https://github.com/athaapa/contextflow)** - A Python library for context optimization and compression for AI agents. 
- **[Axis](https://github.com/athaapa/axis)** - A 3D graphing calculator for multivariable calculus.

## What I'm thinking about
- Using AI to simulate piano physics.  
- Experimenting with Web3/Blockchain technologies.
