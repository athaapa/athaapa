# Hi, I'm Ayush ðŸ‘‹

I build software tools, work on games, and explore projects in math, programming, and hardware.  

## Projects
- **[Axis](https://github.com/athaapa/axis)** â€“ A 3D graphing calculator for multivariable calculus, with a solver and interactive visualizations.  

## What I'm exploring
- Using AI to simulate piano physics.  
- Building an aspect-based recommender for anime.  
- Experimenting with Web3/Blockchain technologies (Solana and Sui).
